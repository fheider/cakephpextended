CakePHP Extended
===============

### CakePHP with additional features

The Core Package of CakePHP is very small and so some nice features still missing out-of-box. So everytime you start developing a new CakePHP application, you have to add the same features and librarys.

### So here starts CakePHP Extended and add:

#### Libraries:

- jQuery Version 1.9.1
- Twitter Bootstrap Version 2.3.1 
- FontAwesome Version 3.11
- jQuery Tools

#### Elements:

- FORM-HELPER: Datepicker
- FORM-HELPER: Range
- HTML-HELPER: Progressbar

The package is like CakePHP ready for use.
